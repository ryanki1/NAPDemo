Once the mandate for the NAP process has been produced, it should be communi-cated formally to all government offices, and widely to the public using convention-al means. In cases where the mandate already existed through published national climate change strategies, the relevant information should be communicated well.

Possible elements of a national mandate for the NAP process are given in Box 3. Ex-amples of mandate instruments, using an act or an executive order, are given in the annex for the United Kingdom and the United States of America, respectively.



Box 3. Possible elements of a national mandate for the NAP process

A national mandate for the NAP process could include specifications on the following, inter alia:

•	Designation of a leader for the NAP process (e.g. someone to head the process, supported by a committee, department or ministry, or board);

•	Elaboration of specific steps to be taken to implement the mandate, such as the elaboration of a framework and strategy;

•	A budget for the NAP process, or an indication of allocated national re-sources and plans for raising additional funds;

•	Reporting instructions on the outcomes of the NAP process over time;

•	An indicative timeline of key milestones and outputs of the NAP process;

•	Instructions on how the formal outputs would be processed and ap-proved including endorsement, nature of public and stakeholder involve-ment and input, and an indication of triggers for revisions and updates of the NAP.

A.1.d	Operationalize the NAP process through access to support

The COP has provided guidance to the GEF, as the operating entity of the financial mechanism of the Convention for the operation of the Least Developed Countries Fund (LDCF), to provide funding from the LDCF to LDC Parties to meet the agreed full cost, as appropriate, of activities to enable the preparation of the NAP process as described in the elements contained in paragraphs 2–6 of the initial guidelines for the formulation of national adaptation plans in the annex to decision 5/CP.17.12
The LDC Parties will use modalities developed by the GEF to access the LDCF (funding as well capacity-building and technical support that would be delivered through support programmes implemented under the LDCF in response to para-graph 23 of decision 5/CP.17).13

Funding and support from the LDCF would be complemented by other, multi-lateral, bilateral and national sources. As part of a proposal to access resources from the LDCF, whether through direct access or through a GEF agency, a flexible and adapted work plan would be developed, given that the NAP process will evolve based on national circumstances and will be flexible to accommodate develop-ments as they happen.
